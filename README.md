# Puffin OpenGL Engine ver. 2.0
3D graphics rendering engine written in C++ and OpenGL API.

Previous version of this engine is no longer developed. I decided to create a new version from scratch. It am working on this project only in my free time, so it is still under development. I am trying to add new features and fix bugs as often as I can.

## Features
  - Phong and Blinn-Phong lighting,
  - Dynamic shadow mapping (directional and point lights) with PCF,
  - Fog,
  - Normal mapping,
  - Antialiasing,
  - Skybox reflections,
  - Water reflections and refractions,
  - Particle effects,
  - Postprocessing effects,
  - HDR and bloom effect,
  - Integration with IMGUI.
